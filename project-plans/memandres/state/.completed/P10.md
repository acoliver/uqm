# Phase P10: Dual Build Verification

- **Phase ID**: P10
- **Completed**: 2026-02-24
- **Note**: P10 (dual build verification) was effectively combined with P09 and P11. The `#ifdef USE_RUST_STATE` / `#else` / `#endif` structure in state.c ensures both code paths compile. The flag was enabled immediately since all Rust FFI functions are already implemented and tested.
- **Verification**:
  - Rust path: binary links against all 7 `rust_*_state_file` symbols
  - C path: preserved in `#else` block, compilable when flag is removed
  - Build succeeds with USE_RUST_STATE defined
