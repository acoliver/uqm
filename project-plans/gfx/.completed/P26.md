# Phase Completion: P26

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20260223-GFX-FULL-PORT.P26`

## Timestamp

## Status: PARTIAL (3 of 39 C files guarded)

## Summary
Guard finalization is partial. Only 3 scaler files could be safely guarded
(2xscalers_mmx.c, 2xscalers_sse.c, 2xscalers_3dnow.c) plus the 2 pre-existing
guards (sdl_common.c, scalers.c) = 5 total.

### Why most files can't be guarded yet:
1. **Symbol name mismatch**: Rust exports `rust_*` prefixed names while C callers
   use original C symbol names (e.g., `TFB_DrawCanvas_Line` vs `rust_canvas_draw_line`)
2. **Dependency chains**: Scaler files reference lookup tables in 2xscalers.c which
   is referenced by scalers.c — can't guard 2xscalers.c without also guarding scalers.c
3. **Widget dependency tree**: frame.c/font.c/context.c/drawable.c are called by
   widgets.c which is called by game logic — all must be bridged together

### Path forward:
- Symbol-level dispatch: `#ifdef USE_RUST_GFX` macros in headers that redirect
  C symbol names to `rust_*` equivalents
- Or: Linker-level symbol aliasing
- Or: Complete game-logic port that eliminates C callers
