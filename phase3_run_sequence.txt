# Phase 3 Run Sequence for Triggering File and Clock Operations

## Objective
Trigger both file operations and clock ticks during a single game session to verify Rust implementations.

## Run Sequence Steps

1. **Start the game**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/acoliver/projects/uqm/sc2
   ./uqm-debug
   ```

2. **Navigate to Load Menu (triggers fileExists)**
   - Press Enter to dismiss intro screens
   - Navigate through menus until you see "Load Game" option
   - This will trigger fileExists calls to check for save files
   - Expected log marker: `RUST_FILE_EXISTS_CALLED`

3. **Start a new game**
   - Select "New Game" from main menu
   - This triggers file operations to load game assets

4. **Engage hyperspace (triggers clock ticks)**
   - Once in-game, press SPACE or equivalent key to access starmap
   - Select a destination and engage hyperspace
   - Stay in hyperspace for ~5 seconds
   - This triggers multiple GameClockTick calls
   - Expected log marker: `RUST_CLOCK_TICK` (multiple times)

5. **Exit cleanly**
   - Press ESC or equivalent to return to main menu
   - Select "Quit" or press appropriate key to exit
   - Ensure clean shutdown

## Expected Log Markers

After following this sequence, rust-bridge.log should contain:
- `RUST_BRIDGE_PHASE0_OK` - Initialization marker
- `RUST_FILE_EXISTS_CALLED` - File operations triggered
- `RUST_CLOCK_INIT` - Clock initialization (optional, may not be visible)
- `RUST_CLOCK_TICK` - Clock ticks during hyperspace
- Possibly `RUST_COPY_FILE_CALLED` if save game is created

## Notes

- The log file will be created in the current working directory (sc2/)
- Each marker should appear with appropriate frequency
- Hyperspace time is critical: stay for ~5 seconds to ensure multiple ticks
- Load menu is the easiest way to trigger fileExists checks
