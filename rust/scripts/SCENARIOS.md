# Runtime automation paths

Automation can either play through normal game state or, for tests that do not
need navigation coverage, activate a deterministic start scene.

## Real Sol probe proof

`real-sol-autopilot.json` is the authoritative regression proof for the opening
Ur-Quan probe encounter. It does not inject a scene or force encounter state.
It:

1. Selects New Game through the normal main-menu input path.
2. Confirms interplanetary activity.
3. Uses `navigate_to_planet` to steer player one via production thrust/left/right controls.
4. Observes the real outer-to-inner transition for Earth (planet index 2).
5. Waits for the naturally spawned race-23 probe to intercept the flagship.
6. Uses `assert_dispatch` to require encounter conversation 24 (`URQUAN_DRONE`)
   and dialogue conversation 18 (`URQUAN`).
7. Captures the rendered conversation.

Run from `rust/`:

```sh
pkill -x uqm 2>/dev/null || true
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
  perl -e 'alarm 120; exec @ARGV' \
  ./target/release/uqm \
  --automation-script=scripts/real-sol-autopilot.json \
  --automation-output=/tmp/uqm-real-sol-autopilot
```

Successful trace evidence includes:

```text
navigation_reached:planet=2
dispatch_verified:encounter=24:dialogue=18
```

The output capture is `captures/real-probe-encounter.png`.

## Player controls and navigation

Use `set_player_key` or `tap_player_key` for raw production gameplay controls.
Supported keys are `thrust`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `weapon`, `special`, and
`escape`. These differ from menu keys: menu direction actions do not move the
flagship.

`navigate_to_planet` is a feedback-driven action:

```json
{"action": "navigate_to_planet", "planet": 2, "max_ticks": 1800}
```

It samples read-only solar-system state and applies player controls on each
input callback. It succeeds only after the real game enters the target planet's
inner system. `max_ticks` contributes to script budget validation and the
script's global watchdog remains the terminal safety bound.

## Deterministic start scenes

Scripts may alternatively declare root-level `start_scene`. A scene is consumed
once after New Game initializes structures and events, before the first activity
dispatch. This is useful for targeted rendering/dialogue tests, but it is not a
substitute for real-path navigation proofs.

`sol-probe-scene-v1.json` demonstrates the mechanism. Its `assert_scene` action
requires encounter conversation 24 and dialogue conversation 18.

## Adding another start scene

1. Add a closed `AutomationScene` variant in `automation/scenario.rs`.
2. Add its pure `ScenePlan`, including expected encounter/dialogue evidence.
3. Add runtime setup in `scenario::activate`; keep it deterministic and let the
   normal game loop perform dispatch.
4. Add parsing, unknown-value, one-shot, safe-boundary, setup-plan, and wrong-
   dispatch tests.
5. Add a script containing both `assert_scene` and `capture`.
