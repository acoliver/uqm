# Phase Completion: P07 C Header Redirect TDD

## Phase ID: PLAN-20260224-MEM-SWAP.P07
## Timestamp: 2026-02-24
## Status: PASS

## Test Results
1. C path (flag OFF): Compilation succeeds, links and runs normally
2. Rust path (flag ON): Compilation succeeds - w_memlib.c correctly excluded by Makeinfo
   - Linker fails with pre-existing DCQ symbols (BroadcastCondVar etc.) - NOT caused by memory changes
   - Verified same linker error occurs on clean code without our changes
3. #error guard: Fires correctly when w_memlib.c compiled with -DUSE_RUST_MEM
4. All 6 Rust memory symbols exported from libuqm_rust.a

## Pre-existing Linker Error Evidence
- Same "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64" error occurs WITHOUT our changes
- Missing symbols (BroadcastCondVar, ClearSemaphore, etc.) are threading symbols from dcqueue.c
- NOT from libuqm_rust.a or memory module
