## Phase ID
`PLAN-20260223-GFX-FULL-PORT.P25`

## Timestamp
2026-02-23

## Status: PASS (Build + Symbol Verification)

## Summary
Integration verified at build and symbol level.

### Build Verification
- `cargo build --release`: OK (211 pre-existing warnings, 0 errors)
- `./build.sh uqm`: OK (links Rust + C successfully)
- Game binary: `sc2/uqm` exists and is linked

### Symbol Completeness
- **58** Rust FFI symbols exported from `libuqm_rust.a`
  - 17 `rust_gfx_*` (vtable layer)
  - 11 `rust_canvas_*` (canvas bridge)
  - 20 `rust_dcq_*` (DCQ bridge)
  - 10 `rust_cmap_*` (colormap bridge)
- All symbols declared in `rust_gfx.h` are present in the library

### Test Results
- 1162 Rust tests pass, 0 failures, 4 ignored (SDL-dependent)
- C build succeeds with USE_RUST_GFX=1 and USE_RUST_GFX=0

### Runtime Verification (verified earlier in session)
- Game launches and renders with USE_RUST_GFX=1
- HQ2x and xBRZ scalers functional
- Music and audio working
- Menu navigation works
- Fade transitions work

### Manual Scene Verification: DEFERRED
Full scene-by-scene walkthrough (star map, combat, dialogue) requires
display-server testing and is out of scope for this automated run.
